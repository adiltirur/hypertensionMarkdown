Blood pressure is the pressure that the blood exerts on the walls of the blood vessels. It depends to a large extent on two factors, which can vary from person to person: The pressure with which our heart pumps the blood into the circulation and the elasticity and diameter of the vessels (arteries). If the blood pressure permanently exceeds certain limits, it is called high blood pressure or hypertension. However, these limits, with which a doctor would diagnose hypertension, do not apply to every person in every situation. Instead, these limits depend on the type of blood pressure measurement (e.g. [self-measurement](92), [practice measurement](95), [long-term measurement](97)) and various other factors, such as [age](11) and [concomitant diseases](150). For example, an older person may well have slightly higher blood pressure values than a younger person, without requiring treatment. Above certain limits, however, high blood pressure is always present.

Blood pressure is regulated, among other things, by a large number of hormones in interaction with the autonomic nervous system. In hypertension (high blood pressure) there is a disturbance in the finely tuned control circuit between the hormonal, nervous and vascular systems and the blood pressure. There are many causes for a disturbance of this control circuit. The factors and mechanisms that lead to high blood pressure are largely understood today.

In [primary or essential hypertension](68) the interaction of heredity (high blood pressure in the family of blood relatives) and lifestyle (including weight, exercise, stress, diet) play a decisive role. The development of hypertension in old age is strongly influenced by the aging of the vessels and the stiffening and arteriosclerosis of the arteries.

    "content": """
Hypertensive crisis or hypertensive derailment is the term used to describe significantly elevated blood pressure values that occur without serious complaints (symptoms). In contrast, a hypertensive emergency exists when the (acute) increase in blood pressure is accompanied by typical symptoms and [complaints](126). In this case, immediate medical advice and treatment is necessary. Typical complaints are, for example, clouding of consciousness, speech or vision disorders, shortness of breath, chest pain (angina pectoris), severe dizziness or severe headaches.

These complaints can occur alone or in combination and can also occur independently of the blood pressure level or a derailment of the blood pressure. The decisive factor is not the absolute blood pressure values, but the symptomatology of the complaint. A [stroke](138) with [paralysis](128), [speech](129) or [visual disturbances](130) can occur independently of the current blood pressure level, just as, for example, a [heart attack](139) with typical [angina pectoris](132) (pain or tightness behind the breastbone radiating into the arm or neck, [shortness of breath](133), nausea ...).

In most cases, however, the acute derailment of blood pressure is a so-called hypertensive crisis. As mentioned above, a crisis is defined as high blood pressure without corresponding symptoms and complaints. Then, for a short period of time, the blood pressure can rise to values of up to 200 mmHg systolic or higher. Even in cases of mild [headache](131) or mild [dizziness](134), an acute drastic reduction in blood pressure is not necessarily required. Because a too rapid and too strong blood pressure reduction is not without risk; it can, for example, lead to circulatory disorders of the brain.

**Temporarily increased blood pressure values often occur in everyday life, but are usually harmless.**

In general it can be said that occasional blood pressure peaks in everyday life are somewhat overrated compared to permanently elevated blood pressure levels. This means that occasional blood pressure peaks (as opposed to permanent high blood pressure) usually do not have any long-term negative consequences. There is always a cause or reason for an acute rise or peak in blood pressure, e.g. irregular or forgotten medication, [stress](39), worries, fears. Particularly frequently, [self-measurement](92) in an anxious expectation and inner tension is itself the trigger for an acute rise in blood pressure during measurement. This happens when the rules of self-measurement are not taken into account, the measurement is not performed in a relaxed situation and calm atmosphere and no follow-up measurements are taken after relaxation.

In everyday life, blood pressure peaks are measured again and again, which often occur during the afternoon or early evening. There can be various reasons for this: The daily course of blood pressure shows, similar to the steep rise in the morning, a smaller rise in the late afternoon; in addition, there are often psychological and mental aspects such as loneliness, inner tension, as is very often observed in (older) single persons, as well as a certain (negative) expectation when measuring blood pressure. The blood pressure measurement itself is then problematic and increases blood pressure because the fear of an elevated blood pressure value itself acutely causes the blood pressure to rise during the measurement. The blood pressure usually drops again after a short period of relaxation, which becomes apparent when the measurement is repeated.

These mostly symptom-free or low symptom blood pressure peaks do not meet the criteria of a hypertensive emergency and do not require acute treatment. If a blood pressure peak occurs in everyday life during [self-measurement](92), it is important to first [relax](193) and then measure again after a few minutes. Usually, the blood pressure is then already significantly lower at the second measurement than at the first measurement. This is also the reason for the recommendation that the [self-measurement](92) of the blood pressure should always be taken twice at intervals of a few minutes. If elevated values are measured, a third measurement may also be necessary.

Blood pressure rises continuously with age. This mainly affects the systolic blood pressure, while the diastolic blood pressure drops again from the 5th decade of life. However, hypertension is not normal even in old age and should be treated accordingly in older people. Numerous studies have shown that the therapy of hypertension in old age is particularly successful, i.e: Those who are treated accordingly suffer strokes and heart muscle weakness less frequently in comparison. Today, therefore, even 80-year-old and older hypertensive patients are treated. This particularly affects "spry" and mobile elderly people.

However, it is important to know that the older organism reacts more sensitively to medication. This is taken into account in the choice and dosage of medication. The [non-medicinal measures](186) are also highly recommended in old age.

        "Especially in middle age, many factors come together (overweight, decreasing physical activity, higher stress in everyday life, etc.) that promote high blood pressure.",
    "content": """
Primary hypertension usually begins in middle age. Often, several factors come together in middle adulthood that contribute to the development of manifest hypertension: physical activity decreases, body weight increases, and the stress in everyday life increases, e.g. occupational stress and family problems. In addition, financial and existential worries often arise.

So-called [masked hypertension](72) refers to increased values in everyday life or at work, whereas normal values are measured in the same person in a relaxed situation at the doctor's office. The background is a stress-induced increase in blood pressure in everyday life, which is "masked" by the measurement of normal values at the doctor's office, i.e. it cannot be detected by the doctor in the practice. Middle aged men are particularly affected).

The causes of high blood pressure in middle age include heredity, lifestyle and physical constitution.

**Causes for high blood pressure in middle age**

**Heredity:** High blood pressure is more common in several members of the same family. In about half of all hypertensive patients, high blood pressure is known to be present in the parents or blood relatives. The predisposition to high blood pressure can therefore be hereditary. It is not yet known which factors exactly play a role in this. One known factor is the altered regulation of the salt balance. Hypertensive patients with a family predisposition are therefore particularly sensitive to salt, i.e. they react to increased salt consumption with an increase in blood pressure. On the other hand, these persons also benefit particularly from a reduction in salt. Since one cannot influence the hereditary disposition, it is all the more important to take lifestyle factors into account. These ultimately lead to the development and manifestation of high blood pressure.

**Lifestyle:** Overweight, lack of exercise, smoking, increased salt consumption, elevated cholesterol levels and stress are the most important factors that can drive up blood pressure over the years. For example, the combination of smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, and elevated cholesterol levels can lead to premature vascular stiffening as early as age 45, with the development of systolic hypertension, which is usually not usually seen until old age. Diastolic hypertension is somewhat more frequent in younger years, as is the combination of systolic and diastolic hypertension.

Chronic stress, e.g. at work and/or in the family, in combination with lack of sleep or sleep disorders are other important factors in the development of hypertension. Living alone is now also identified as a risk factor for hypertension.

**Constitution:** Besides body weight, height is also a factor that plays a role in the development of hypertension: [Taller people](23) have a lower risk of developing hypertension than [short people](24). Among other things, the length of the vessels (e.g. the aorta) plays a certain role.

In children and young hypertensive patients with systolic and diastolic blood pressure elevation, any organic causes (secondary forms of hypertension) that can be remedied must be identified and treated by appropriate examinations. Causes may include kidney disease, vascular anomalies, genetic changes and hormonal imbalances.

More and more often, however, children are at risk of developing primary hypertension if they are overweight and exercise too little. Blood pressure measurement in children must be carried out with special [blood pressure cuffs](91) for children, which are selected according to the circumference of the upper arm. Special [blood pressure standard values](91) for children also apply; these are based on the so-called percentiles.

The so-called [juvenile systolic hypertension (ISH)](71) in adolescents and young adults (predominantly slim, tall and athletic male adolescents), on the other hand, is a benign increase in systolic blood pressure with normal or low diastolic values. This elevation of blood pressure is not associated with an increased risk and does not require treatment.

Women in their early 20s have lower blood pressure than men. However, they increase more than men throughout adulthood and overtake them at around the age of 60.

With the menopause and especially afterwards, many women develop hypertension. This development is often accompanied by weight gain, an increase in blood lipid values and blood sugar until the development of diabetes. The protective factor due to the high concentration of female sex hormones at a young age is lost and the risk of cardiovascular disease increases significantly in women after the menopause. Hypertension now occurs more frequently than in men of the same age. It is therefore not surprising that women at 65 have, so to speak, "caught up" with men in terms of heart disease. Cardiovascular diseases in older women more frequently affect the small heart vessels (so-called microvascular angina pectoris) and so-called diastolic heart failure with stiffening of the left ventricle and the thoracic aorta.

The hormones estradiol and progesterone have a certain blood pressure-lowering effect in women of childbearing age before menopause. This "protective effect" is lost in the menopause and blood pressure can rise. Whether hormone administration in the menopause (hormone substitution) is useful to favourably influence the development of cardiovascular diseases is still controversial, because in some studies this risk was even increased as a result of hormone administration. If hormone therapy is performed, it should be carried out with transdermal estradiol (hormone patch) if possible. If estradiol is not metabolized by the liver but absorbed through the skin, the effect on blood pressure may be beneficial.

However, being overweight is the most important and most common trigger for the development of hypertension, especially in combination with lack of exercise. Overweight and obesity are also common causes of type 2 diabetes and lipometabolic disorders. A metabolic syndrome is the combined occurrence of overweight, fat and sugar metabolism disorders, elevated uric acid levels and elevated blood pressure. Here the common cause is overweight.

With a measuring tape it is easy to distinguish between favorable and unfavorable fat distribution: One measures the circumference of the waist below the rib arches, slightly above the navel, and the hip circumference at the level of the front pelvic bones. The measured centimeters are related to each other (waist circumference divided by hip circumference): The normal values for the waist-hip ratio (cm/cm) are less than 0.8 for women and less than 1.0 for men.

High blood pressure is more common in certain families. Often one or even both parents of a patient with hypertension also have high blood pressure. Today it is assumed that about 50% of hypertensive patients have a hereditary disposition. Even in childhood, there is a very fine regulatory disorder, which does not necessarily have to be reflected in high blood pressure. Over the years, this inherited disorder slowly develops into manifest hypertension under the influence of other factors (overweight, lack of exercise, excessive salt consumption, stress factors, etc.). In most cases, the manifestation of hypertension occurs in middle adulthood. Which regulatory disorder is inherited is still not known in detail. However, it is widely suggested that the disorder lies in the regulation of the salt balance. The inherited genetic disposition cannot be changed, but salt consumption and other lifestyle factors can be influenced to prevent the manifestation of hypertension.

The practical conclusion from this is that hypertensive people should consume as little salt as possible.

Unfortunately, it is still not possible to identify salt sensitive people with simple laboratory tests.

Basically, the following applies to team and game sports: The more focus is on playing with each other instead of against each other is the more suitable for the hypertensive person. For game sports such as soccer, handball, basketball, volleyball, field hockey, the following applies: As a competition, all these games require a large number of sudden starts and stopping movements. These fast, powerful actions involving large muscle groups cause the blood pressure to skyrocket. In addition, the game situation represents such a strong stimulus that all good intentions, such as holding back, are quickly forgotten. The warning symptoms of the body are often ignored. If ambition or disappointment comes into play, the stress hormones alone can cause blood pressure to skyrocket.

The situation is made worse in many cases by the fact that a large proportion of players enter the game without any physical preparation. Too often, there is no loosening and stretching of the musculature, nor is any thought given to stimulating the cardiovascular system in the first place. However, if all these factors are taken into account and the team sport is carried out sensibly and with enjoyment, this sport is also suitable for hypertension patients.

The more intensively one strains oneself, the more oxygen is needed and the stronger the breathing becomes. The amount of air inhaled can increase from 5-8 liters per minute to 10 to 20 times the amount per minute. However, such quantities of air cannot be handled by nasal breathing alone. Physical exertion requires breathing through the mouth and nose.

If you are not used to physical activity, one should initially ensure that one breathes calmly, not too quickly and sufficiently deeply. This is particularly important for beginners and those returning to sport. For those who are used to physical exertion, e.g. those who are experienced in sports, the breathing is adjusted automatically. The body adapts the breathing to the demand. In this way, breathing can be used as an indicator of the intensity of physical exertion. Whenever it becomes difficult to talk during sports practice, the degree of exertion is quite high.

**Avoidance of pressurized breathing**

Pressed breathing involves holding the air for a short time, i.e. breathing is not used to stabilize or concentrate the trunk muscles.

Pressed breathing is often used not only for high exertion, but also for exercises that only require a high degree of concentration or coordination. Pressed breathing is often observed when solving difficult tasks, even when threading a twine thread into a needle, or during gymnastics during balance and stretching exercises of large muscle groups, such as the muscles of one side of the torso. Pressed breathing increases blood pressure, with enormous short-term peaks, e.g. when lifting weights. It is therefore important to avoid pressurized breathing.

Between high blood pressure and stress there are many different relationships and interactions. Blood pressure reacts immediately in every acute stress reaction with an increase. After the stress is over, the blood pressure drops again more or less quickly. This applies equally to physical, mental and psychological stress. The stress reaction is deeply anchored in our autonomous / vegetative nervous system. The extent of the stress reaction depends on genetic, constitutional, physical and cognitive factors.

Chronic stress is an important factor in the manifestation of permanent hypertension. Specific personal characteristics and behavior can increase the risk of hypertension. For this reason, procedures for stress reduction (stress management, [relaxation](193), physical training, cognitive restructuring, [biofeedback](199) and others) have an important place in the catalog of non-drug measures for lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

Today there is no longer any doubt that psychological factors play a major role in the development of hypertension. Especially anger and anxiety can lead to an increase in blood pressure over time. There is evidence that anxiety plays a greater role for women and anger for men. Ultimately, both factors can be summarized, along with many others, under the generic term stress. The prime example of stress-induced hypertension is the so-called [masked hypertension](72) with elevated blood pressure under everyday stress and normal values in the doctor's office.

If this rhythm is in balance, we are healthy. Stress means a predominant tension due to too much work, too many problems, overstraining, overexertion etc. If this happens over a longer period of time (chronic stress), it can lead to serious health problems. A basic problem is that stress is not perceived at all by the person affected over a long period of time and cannot be measured by a doctor simply like blood pressure, cholesterol or blood sugar values.

**Typical stress triggers (stressors) are high time pressure, hectic pace, excessive demands, family or financial worries.

If one wants to understand the effects of stress on the organism and the possibilities of stress reduction, it is helpful to first define the term: One must distinguish between stress factors (stressors) and stress reactions. Today's stress factors are, above all, time pressure, hectic pace, family, professional and financial problems and overstraining. These are therefore factors that come towards us largely independently of our will. In addition, there are of course also stress factors for which one is responsible, such as poor time planning, overstraining or overestimating oneself. Above all, we can reduce the influence of such stress factors on health and well-being.
The term **Eustress** refers to the "healthy" everyday stress that is managed (for example, because the problems can basically be solved) and that has no harmful effects on health. In contrast, **Distress** refers to chronic, unresolved stress with harmful consequences for health.

The stress response is the way our body reacts to stress factors. As different as the individual stress factors can be, so different can be the organic stress response. Why one person gets a stomach ulcer due to chronic professional or family-related stress, another migraine and the third person high blood pressure, is ultimately not clear. It is very likely, however, that different genetic predispositions (hereditary factors) are decisive for the different stress responses. The weakest organ systems, be it the stomach, the head or the circulatory system, are most sensitive to chronic stress. This explains the different patterns of stress response for the same stress factor.

**High blood pressure as a stress reaction is hardly noticeable, therefore so dangerous.**

The "advantage" of headaches, stomach aches or heart pain in or after a stressful situation is that the body sends out a noticeable signal, namely pain; this enables the person affected to get to the bottom of his or her complaints more easily. Worse off are patients who react with high blood pressure, whose blood vessels constrict, whose blood sugar rises or whose blood clotting changes because all these stress consequences cannot be perceived immediately: They do not cause any complaints. However, it is precisely these imperceptible changes that can lead to serious disturbances and even heart attacks. Today there is no longer any doubt that chronic stress is a very important cause of hypertension and heart attack. However, the fact that stress is relatively difficult to measure and quantify under everyday conditions is responsible for the fact that the factor stress is still generally neglected in medicine.

It is commonly perceived that stress is necessary and belongs to the life. To a certain extent this is also completely correct, because without "healthy" stress reactions mankind would not have survived. For many millions of years our ancestors were dependent on fast reactions of blood circulation, metabolism and blood coagulation in order to survive in the steppe or in the jungle: Attack and flight are only possible if forces can be mobilized "as fast as lightning". For this purpose, sufficient energy, i.e. sugar and fats as well as oxygen, must be provided. Blood pressure and pulse must be raised reflexively to supply the muscles with sufficient nutrients and oxygen. Blood coagulation must also function immediately in the event of injury. It is clear that all these stress reactions originally had a life-supporting effect and made survival possible in the first place.

These old stress reactions have been deeply rooted in us for 1000 generations as escape and fear reflexes. Unfortunately, in our modern world they are also activated when we sit at our desk, at the workbench or at the bank counter, under stress. In these situations, a fast heartbeat and high blood pressure are no longer needed as escape reflexes, but they are also not dissipated again and can lead to hypertension and heart attack (in the long term) via the mechanisms described above.

It has already been explained that many factors play a role in the development of hypertension. This is why there is also not one, classical hypertension personality. However, studies have shown that in addition to the abnormalities known as [type A behavior](44), certain personality traits can be observed repeatedly in hypertensive patients. Hypertension patients often experience themselves as unattractive, unpopular, disregarded, not assertive and criticized in their work. This considerably limits their self-esteem and their ability to assert their own interests in life. Hypertension patients are therefore also more dependent on their outside world and bend to its conditions. This in turn can lead to an inability to act aggressively. This becomes externally visible in increased self-control, in an excessive love for order, in restraint, love for truth and inability to act impulsively and spontaneously. This does not mean that hypertension patients should necessarily become untidy and uncontrolled. The right balance is healthy! Hypertonics describe themselves out of excessive self-criticism rather more negatively than it would be objectively justified. Because their own image does not match the image that their fellow people have of them!

Of course, the psychological picture drawn here, which is somewhat gloomy, does not apply to all hypertonics in every point and to the same extent.

**Strongly stressful events from childhood can later have an effect in the form of high blood pressure.**

Many causes of later high blood pressure can go back a long way in the past. Mental injuries and psychological trauma in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood can be traced in many hypertensive patients. For a long time these events were repressed and successfully suppressed. At some point, however, the ability to suppress these memories diminishes, either through fatigue of the defense mechanisms or through additional emotional injuries. This can even lead to a crisis-like increase in blood pressure. This is where a particularly sensitive therapy is required. Our vegetative nervous system reacts to psychological stress in the same way as it reacts to physical danger. However, the increased level of activity is not reduced by physical exercise, but damages the heart and blood vessels.

Time pressure and impatience are two factors that have been identified as long-term risk factors for the development of hypertension, especially in young adults. This was shown by a scientific study in the USA called the "Cora Study".

In our society, especially people from "educationally disadvantaged" classes tend to lead unhealthy lifestyles. However, lifestyle factors probably have a greater impact on blood pressure than social status per se.

Special environmental stress such as noise has an unfavorable effect on blood pressure. Studies show that there are more hypertensives in areas with increased street noise than in quieter areas. This also applies to areas with increased aircraft noise pollution. Excessive noise pollution or heat exposure at the workplace can also lead to an increase in blood pressure. Toxins such as cadmium, lead and thallium can increase blood pressure. Painters and plumbers are particularly exposed to occupational lead pollution. Shift work is another health problem.

Blood pressure reacts less to "weather" than to temperature differences. Contrary to a widespread opinion, blood pressure is higher in winter than in summer - in January / February by an average of about 5 mmHg compared to the summer months. This is due to the influence of temperature on vessel width: cold leads to vasoconstriction and thus to an increase in blood pressure. This is particularly pronounced in the event of sudden exposure to strong cold, e.g. when jumping into the plunge pool after a sauna session.

The influence of the climate, be it maritime climate, low mountain or high mountain climate, is also often overestimated. There is no climate that is particularly suitable or unsuitable for hypertension patients: high blood pressure is just as common on the coast as in low or high mountain regions. When changing location or climate, the acclimatization phase is important: whether at the seaside or in the mountains, you should allow yourself a few days of rest and time to acclimatize at the beginning, and only then increase physical activity. With increasing "civilization degree" the "weather sensitivity" in our population increases: The less hardened and fit one is, the more susceptible one becomes for weather changes.

Smokers are usually slimmer than non-smokers, as nicotine activates the metabolism.

    "content": """
It was already known in China during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) that salt hardenes the vessels. Too much common salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) promotes the increase in blood volume (table salt binds water in the body), increases the readiness of the blood vessels to constrict and leads to vascular stiffening.

These factors, in turn, can increase blood pressure, and thus increased salt consumption over a long period of time is a cause of the development of hypertension. The blood pressure-increasing effect is caused by the sodium and chloride content of table salt. For practical reasons, however, the sodium content of food and beverages should be taken into account. One gram (1000 mg) of table salt contains 400 mg of sodium. By nature, there is no foodstuff that contains as much sodium as one gram of table salt, even in a quantity of 100 g.

**Conversion factors:**

* 1.0 g sodium (Na) corresponds to 2.5 g table salt (NaCl).
* 1.0 g table salt corresponds to 0.4 g sodium.

    "content": """
Alcohol is important for blood pressure. Chronic high alcohol consumption can be the cause of severe hypertension. In these patients it has been shown that, in some cases, their blood pressure drops to normal values after a reduction in alcohol intake or when they are completely abstinent. However, total abstinence from alcohol is only necessary in cases of alcohol dependency. It is important to limit the alcohol intake to a low and reasonable quantity. Individual alcohol tolerance varies greatly. Similar to salt, there are probably also alcohol-sensitive people whose organism tolerates less alcohol and tends to respond with pathological reactions. On average, women tolerate only about ⅓ of the amount of alcohol that men usually tolerate before physical damage manifests itself. The alcohol damage affects not only the cardiovascular system, but also the nervous system, the liver, the metabolism, sexual functions and many other organ systems.

**What does moderate alcohol consumption mean?**

Alcohol has many calories (1 g has 7 kcal) and can therefore also indirectly lead to hypertension via weight gain. After all, 20-30% of the excess calories consumed by more than half of hypertension patients come from alcohol! In addition, there is also a direct influence of alcohol on the sympathetic nervous system, which leads to high blood pressure.

Recommendation of maximum alcohol intake per day:
* Women: 20 g
* Men: 30 g
20-25 g alcohol correspond to about
* ¼ liters of wine or
* ½ liters of beer or
* 2-3 shots

Overweight hypertensive patients should reduce their consumption and patients with difficult to control hypertension should avoid alcohol altogether. Otherwise, alcohol in reasonable amounts is unproblematic for hypertensive patients.

Vitamin D plays an essential role in the regulation of calcium metabolism and thus also influences the regulation of blood pressure. Recent studies show that a lack of vitamin D is found more frequently among hypertensive patients and that taking vitamin D can lower blood pressure. Vitamin D is produced by the body by ultraviolet light in the skin. A deficiency therefore occurs particularly during low sun exposure and in winter. In the diet, vitamin D is mainly found in fatty fish and dairy products. A vitamin deficiency does not cause acute symptoms, but can cause various organ and cell disorders on a permanent basis. One can measure the vitamin D level in the blood. If a vitamin D deficiency is proven, the diet should be changed and possibly vitamin D should be taken in tablet form over a certain period of time. This treatment must of course be prescribed and monitored by a doctor. Other vitamins have no significant effect on the regulation of blood pressure.

Primary hypertension is present in about 90% of cases of high blood pressure (formerly known as essential hypertension). Several very different factors can contribute to the development of high blood pressure. There are various combinations of systolic and/or diastolic hypertension. In the list below, various factors are listed that are more likely to indicate a primary or secondary form of hypertension.

**Probably primary hypertension**

* Often only mild hypertension (140-159 mmHg systolic, 90-99 mmHg diastolic),
* slower and "silent" start,
* no further symptoms,
* Hypertension known in the family (hereditary form), especially in combination with high salt consumption,
* Overweight and lack of exercise,
* high alcohol consumption,
* Chronic stress at work or in the family,
* normal day/night blood pressure profile in long-term measurement,
* Antihypertensives work well and even in a small dose.

**Probably secondary hypertension**

* Moderate or severe hypertension,
* diastolic blood pressure is also constantly elevated,
* difficult to adjust blood pressure, high blood pressure due to: kidney diseases, hormonal disorders of the adrenal gland or thyroid, vascular diseases such as renal artery stenosis or aortic isthmus stenosis (in boys), sleep apnoea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, taking the "pill",
* Taking other medicines such as cortisone, painkillers.

In young and middle-aged hypertensive patients, isolated increases in diastolic blood pressure may initially occur, such as a 36-year-old hypertensive patient with a blood pressure of 135/105 mmHg. Here, the upper (systolic) value is still within the normal range and the lower (diastolic) value is significantly elevated. This constellation is typically found at the beginning of primary hypertension in middle age. This is caused by an increase in the so-called peripheral resistance of the arterial vessels (i.e. the resistance of blood and vessels to the pumping force of the heart muscle). IDH (isolated diastolic hypertension) is defined as increased diastolic blood pressure with normal systolic values: <140/>90 mmHg (based on practice measurement).

Isolated systolic hypertension is more common in older age, as systolic blood pressure usually increases continuously with age.

The heart has to build up a higher pressure to pump the blood into the stiffened vessels. The diastolic blood pressure is normal or low because the peripheral resistance is not increased - in contrast to diastolic hypertension in younger years. ISH (Isolated Systolic Hypertension) is defined as elevated systolic blood pressure with normal or low diastolic values: >140/<90 mmHg (based on practice measurement).

Increasingly, however, ISH is also observed in younger years in cases of premature vascular stiffening due to smoking, elevated cholesterol levels, obesity and lack of exercise.

In young men all hypertension constellations occur, both systolic and diastolic and systolic plus diastolic hypertension. Systolic hypertension is also increasingly found in young men as a result of an unhealthy lifestyle with obesity, lack of exercise, nicotine consumption, lipometabolic disorders and stress. There is an increased risk of subsequent damage to the cardiovascular system.

In contrast, ISH (Isolated Systolic Hypertension) in slim and athletic adolescents and young men is caused by a strong so-called amplification (benign increase) of the pressure wave from the thoracic aorta to the measurement point in the arm artery. By means of [pulse wave analysis](116) amplification values up to 60 mmHg can be measured. Tall, slim, athletic adolescents and young men are particularly affected. The increased amplification with high systolic values in the arm artery is an expression of a particular vascular elasticity and/or increased heart beat volume (ejection capacity of the heart) with low or normal blood pressure in the thoracic aorta. The prognosis is accordingly good and a blood pressure-lowering therapy is not necessary according to the guidelines. In contrast to the ISH in old age, the higher the blood pressure amplitude (difference between systolic and diastolic values) in boys, the better the prognosis.

This phenomenon is rarely observed in girls and young women.

Masked hypertension is defined as a form of hypertension in which blood pressure is normal when measured in the practice, but elevated values are measured in everyday life outside the practice, e.g. with ambulatory long-term measurement or during self-measurement of blood pressure. Masked hypertension is the classic form of stress-induced hypertension with elevated blood pressure in everyday work under high stress and normal blood pressure values measured in the practice at rest. This form of hypertension is not detected by the sole measurement in the practice, i.e. it is masked. It can only be unmasked, i.e. detected, if the blood pressure is measured outside the doctor's office, in everyday life.

**If masked hypertension is detected, therapy is necessary.**

Obviously, the affected people are more relaxed when measuring in the doctor's office and have lower blood pressure values compared to the situation at work or in the home environment. Affected are mainly middle-aged men with unhealthy behavior and lifestyle factors. Treatment is essential because masked hypertension is associated with a high cardiovascular risk.

Secondary hypertension is the term used to describe an increase in blood pressure from a singular cause that can be identified and possibly corrected by means of defined diagnostic steps. Because of the frequency of primary hypertension, however, there is also the simultaneous occurrence of primary and secondary hypertension, or it can develop from a primary to a secondary form: A longstanding primary hypertension that has not been treated or has been insufficiently treated can lead to an arteriosclerotic renal artery stenosis (narrowing of a renal artery) or a functional weakness of the kidneys (renal insufficiency).

Secondary forms of hypertension are comparatively uncommon, some of them even a rarity. It is estimated that only 5-10% of all hypertension cases involve secondary forms of hypertension. Organic causes can be detected by appropriate examinations (blood and urine tests, ultrasound and other procedures). The diagnosis of an organic cause is important, as there is often an underlying cause that can be remedied and, for example, surgery can then make lifelong medication unnecessary. In children there are some special diseases that lead to hypertension.

Hypertensive patients snore more often than people with normal blood pressure. Snorers should therefore have their blood pressure measured if it is not yet known. Snorers are also more often overweight and at risk of heart attack and stroke. Men are affected far more often than women. Snoring can lead to a threatening lack of oxygen when breathing pauses (apnoea phases) occur with snoring, which last 10 seconds or longer and are more frequent. This is known as sleep apnoea syndrome. In this syndrome, the extreme slackening of the throat muscles temporarily blocks the upper airways. Sleep apnoea syndrome is often associated with abnormal tiredness and sleep compulsion during the day and headaches. During the day, patients feel irritable, sleepless and upset. A doctor should be consulted if all these symptoms occur. The diagnosis can initially be made on an ambulatory basis using the so-called somnography.

**If sleep apnoea syndrome is also present, special attention should be paid to effective blood pressure therapy.**

For patients with sleep apnoea, good blood pressure control is particularly important. Weight reduction is the most important and effective therapy for overweight patients with sleep apnoea: blood pressure is lowered and snoring and breathing pauses are reduced or eliminated. If necessary, night-time ventilation may have to be prescribed for severe forms after an appropriate examination in the sleep laboratory. Patients with sleep apnoea syndrome often have nocturnal hypertension. In this case, a significant increase in blood pressure during the night, during sleep is often observed in ambulatory long-term blood pressure measurement. Correspondingly, additional medication may have to be taken in the evening.

    "content": """
First among the drugs that can cause high blood pressure are the contraceptive ovulation inhibitors ("contraceptive pill"). They are a relatively common cause of hypertension in young women. If high blood pressure is detected in a woman of childbearing age, it is advisable to switch to another method of contraception. If the "pill" was really the cause of hypertension, blood pressure will normalize within 2-3 months after stopping. If the blood pressure does not drop, other causes may be possible, so further examinations are necessary.

Female hormones (estrogens) taken after the menopause, for example to counteract a reduction in mineral salts in the bones (osteoporosis) or to treat climacteric complaints, do not usually lead to hypertension, unlike the "pill".

**Numerous medications can increase blood pressure.**

**Cortisone** is often a vital medication for severe asthma, rheumatism or other chronic diseases. Under long-term cortisone therapy in appropriate doses, blood pressure often rises.

**Phenacetin** was formerly contained in many painkillers and, if taken over a long period of time, leads to kidney damage and high blood pressure, among other things. However, other painkillers, especially when taken in "mixed preparations", can probably also lead to kidney damage if taken over a longer period of time.

With increasing age, the consumption of **antirheumatic and painkillers** for the treatment of arthrosis and arthritis complaints increases. Particularly in patients with hypertension, these substances can lead to an increase in blood pressure and worsen a previously well adjusted blood pressure. Antirheumatic drugs, such as **indomethacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen** and others, can lead to an increase in blood pressure and can cancel or weaken the effect of antihypertensive drugs, especially water tablets (diuretics).

**Antidepressants**, i.e. drugs for depression (so-called MAO-inhibitors), can sometimes trigger a sharp rise in blood pressure after consumption of food containing tyramine (certain types of beer, bananas, yeast, chicken liver, red wine and chocolate). Hypertension patients who take these drugs should discuss this with their doctor. Some antidepressants can also lead to an increase in blood pressure through weight gain.

Caution also with **nose drops**: Long-term use of nose drops with vasoconstrictive substances can lead to an increase in blood pressure and subsequently to manifest hypertension and even stroke.

        "During pregnancy some women develop hypertension. If too high blood pressure values are already measured beforehand, a particularly careful control of the blood pressure during pregnancy is important.",
    "content": """
High blood pressure during pregnancy is a health risk for both mother and child. However, women with known hypertension do not have to give up having children. In the case of hypertension with concomitant kidney disease, diabetes or heart disease, the desire for children must be discussed very carefully with the doctor. Particularly intensive blood pressure monitoring is necessary in order to detect the development of hypertension during pregnancy (gestational hypertension) even in women with initially normal blood pressure values and to prevent so-called "pregnancy poisoning" (gestosis) and the development of eclampsia. Gestational hypertension is for up to 30% a common cause of infant mortality and maternal mortality.

**During pregnancy, blood pressure usually drops slightly at first and then rises again slightly towards the end of the pregnancy.**

Blood pressure usually drops slightly at the beginning of pregnancy or in the first half, with the lowest values between the 16th and 20th week of pregnancy. The reason for this is the hormonal change that occurs during pregnancy. From week 22 onwards, the values increase again until delivery, but should not reach or exceed the norm of 140/90 mmHg (practice measurement) or 135/85 mmHg (self-measurement). Hypertension occurs in about 10-15% of women in the last third of pregnancy. This is associated with an increased risk. It is controversial whether systolic or diastolic blood pressure is more important in pregnancy.

**High blood pressure values in pregnant women in conjunction with protein excretion in the urine are an indication of dangerous pre-eclampsia.**

Especially if protein excretion in the urine is detected at the same time as high blood pressure values, there is a risk of so-called pre-eclampsia. However, pre-eclampsia can also occur without protein excretion. Pre-eclampsia is a dangerous disease for mother and child, the cause of which is seen as a disturbance in the development of blood vessels in the placenta (uterus). There is a risk of delayed growth of the fetus or premature birth. The life of the mother is also at risk. If the eclampsia is not detected and treated in time, an eclamptic seizure with brain edema, lung and kidney failure may occur. Usually high-risk patients are admitted to hospital for monitoring, stabilization, blood pressure adjustment and prevention of complications. If eclampsia occurs, delivery must be initiated immediately.

Early and regular blood pressure measurement during pregnancy and outpatient monitoring are well suited to detect complications in time. Self-measurement of blood pressure is of great importance in this context. With modern technology, the self-measured values can be transmitted digitally directly to the treating physician (so-called telemonitoring of blood pressure).

**During pregnancy, blood pressure should always be measured while sitting in a quiet environment.**

Blood pressure must be measured under standardized conditions, i.e. at the same time of day, at rest, while sitting. When lying down, the blood pressure can be "wrongly" lowered, e.g. due to a cava compression syndrome, in which the uterus with the fetuses presses on the great vena cava and reduces the return flow of blood to the heart, thus lowering the blood pressure. The blood pressure limits for self-measurement are 135/85 mmHg corresponding to the blood pressure in the doctor's office of 140/90 mmHg. In case of hypertension during pregnancy, long-term ambulatory blood pressure measurement over 24 hours is also very useful. In particular, an insufficient night-time lowering of blood pressure (during sleep) during pregnancy can occur or indicate this in the context of pre-eclampsia.

**Pregnancy hypertension**

In about 10-15% of cases, so-called pregnancy hypertension occurs in the last third of pregnancy. This is associated with an increased risk. In particular, if a protein excretion in the urine is detected at the same time, there is a risk of gestation ("pregnancy poisoning"). Hypertension in the last third of pregnancy without protein excretion and without development of a gestosis usually disappears in the weeks following delivery. However, pregnancy hypertension can also develop into permanent hypertension that persists after delivery. Women who develop gestational hypertension very often react again with hypertension during the next pregnancy. In women who have undergone pre-eclampsia, hypertension persists in about 40% of all cases even one year after delivery.

**Gestation is dangerous for mother and child.**

Gestosis is a dangerous disease for both mother and child, the cause of which has not yet been clearly established. Premature birth or stillbirth can occur. If hypertension is not treated in time, it can lead to brain swelling, seizures, heart and kidney failure. With blood pressure values \>140/90 mmHg (practice measurement) or \>135/85 mmHg during self-measurement, close monitoring is therefore necessary. The most suitable method is daily self-measurement of blood pressure by the mother. It is essential to measure it in the evening as late as possible, since in the case of an imminent gestation, the blood pressure increases especially at night. If there is a suspicion of this, an ambulatory blood pressure measurement should be carried out over 24 hours. This can determine whether the blood pressure drops during the sleeping phase, as is normally the case, or whether it remains elevated or even rises during the night. If blood pressure rises during the night, there is an increased probability of gestation.

**What medications can pregnant women take for high blood pressure?**

In any form of hypertension during pregnancy, lowering blood pressure is the most important and successful measure to prevent complications for mother and child. The international trend is towards early (preventive) treatment of high blood pressure during pregnancy.

In order not to harm the unborn child, only drugs to lower blood pressure (antihypertensives) that have been proven not to damage the embryo may be taken during pregnancy. For the treatment of gestational hypertension or gestosis, the antisympathetic drug methyldopa, the beta-blocker metoprolol and the calcium antagonist nifedipine in a sustained release form are preferred. If these substances are not sufficient, other substances such as dihydralazine or labetalol (not available in Germany, however) or diuretics (water tablets) can be used in low doses.

Antihypertensive drugs such as ACE inhibitors or AT1 blockers (Sartane) can damage the embryo and must therefore not be used during pregnancy.

If there is a risk of eclampsia, it is recommended to take aspirin (ASS) in low dosage (100 mg) from the 2nd trimester onwards.

**Breastfeeding period**

During the breastfeeding period after childbirth, all the usual blood pressure reducers can be used. However, there are only a few studies on this. It is therefore advisable to continue to take the medication that was successfully used to lower blood pressure during pregnancy. Possibly a dose adjustment must be made. 

**No salt reduction during pregnancy**

A restriction of salt intake is not recommended during pregnancy. A sufficient amount of salt is necessary for the necessary increase in circulatory volume during pregnancy. The normal salt intake is sufficient for this. An increased intake of common salt is not necessary.

**No licorice during pregnancy.**

If licorice is consumed in excess, the glycyrrhizinic acid from the liquorice root extract can increase blood pressure. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) therefore recommends that pregnant women do not consume more than 100 mg glyzyrrhizin per day. This amount is contained in about 100 g of normal liquorice or 50 g of strong liquorice. Strong liquorice should only be consumed in very small amounts, if at all. These contain more than 200 mg glycyrrhizin per 100 g and must be labelled as strong liquorice in Germany.

    "content": """
An example of this is the term "widow's hypertension", because older single women are actually more frequently affected. The typical daily routine consists of housework in the morning and shopping, possibly with social contacts and corresponding distraction. In the afternoon, the feeling of loneliness is experienced more intensely, often combined with inner tension and possibly physical discomfort. If in this situation the blood pressure is measured in anxious and negative expectations, the blood pressure actually rises during the measurement itself and gives the impression of a hypertensive derailment or crisis. In fact, however, the increased blood pressure is not the cause, but rather the consequence of internal tension. There may be an overreaction with self-admission or hospital admission by the emergency physician. The problem of inadequate self-measurement is not solved.

**How can we check whether there are indeed permanently elevated blood pressure values?**

If the self-measurement is repeated in the case of elevated values after appropriate and successful relaxation, the subsequent values are usually lower and in-patient treatment is unnecessary, especially if no serious symptoms are present. The key to solving this problem therefore lies in the correct measurement of the blood pressure, taking into account the measurement conditions and practicing relaxation techniques. Only then are the values of the [self measurement of blood pressure](92) significant. Whether, for example, afternoon blood pressure peaks actually occur, can best be assessed by the physician using long-term ambulatory blood pressure measurement. Here an objectively normal blood pressure behavior is often shown in contrast to the self-measured subjective values.

        "For the usual blood pressure measurement, the blood in the arm artery is congested with a cuff and slowly released. This procedure applies to the original auscultatory measurement as well as to the modern, oscillometric measurement.",
    "content": """
**History:**
The principle of conventional blood pressure measurement consists of indirect auscultatory (with stethoscope/microphone) or automatic oscillometric measurement using an upper arm cuff over the brachial artery. In 1895, the Turin pediatrician Scipione Riva-Rocci (RR) described the palpatory measurement (pulse sensing at the wrist) of systolic blood pressure using an inflatable cuff on the upper arm and a connected sphygmomanometer (pressure gauge). The determination of the diastolic blood pressure became possible only through the combination of upper arm congestion and auscultation (listening to pulse sounds above the crook of the arm) by the Russian military doctor Nicolai Korotkow in 1905. The popular abbreviation RR can therefore strictly speaking only stand for systolic blood pressure.

For 100 years now, blood pressure has been measured on the upper arm according to the method of Riva-Rocci and Korotkow via auscultation of the typical sound phenomena. The systolic blood pressure is determined at the first occurrence of the sounds by means of a stethoscope over the brachial artery and the diastolic blood pressure at the time of the disappearance of the sounds.

The development of other measurement methods began in the 1980s and has made great progress since then. In particular, the introduction of modern oscillometric measurement (without auscultation) and the combination with electronic and digital technology also in the auscultatory method has made blood pressure measurement easier and also more popular for self measurement. Today, oscillometric automatic blood pressure devices are preferred in the medical practice and for self-measurement.

**Certain conditions must be considered for each blood pressure measurement.**

Regardless of the measuring method and the device, the following conditions must be considered:

* Calm, relaxed situation while sitting after at least 5 minutes rest,
* quiet environment,
* no conversation during the measurement,
* Correct cuff size and position: too large cuffs lead to false low values, too small cuffs lead to false high values, place the lower edge of the cuff approx. 2 cm above the crook of the arm on the undressed upper arm; in case of a thin sleeve it is also possible to measure above it,
* calm and relaxed position of the arm on a surface with the palm facing upwards; the arm must not be bent too much (false low values) and it should also not be held fully extended

For non-automatic or auscultatory measurement, the following must be considered:

* Pulse palpation at the wrist during inflation during non-automatic measurement,
* Drainage speed approx. 2-3 mmHg per second,
* correct (Korotkow phase) and accurate reading of blood pressure values during auscultatory measurement.

**The correct size of the blood pressure cuff is also important.**

The standard cuff is 12-13 cm wide and 24 cm long (inflatable rubber part) and can be used for an upper arm circumference between 24 and maximum 35 cm. If the upper arm is thicker, a wider and longer cuff must be used, because otherwise too high pressures are required with the normal cuff to compress the arm artery. The result is incorrect high blood pressure values. Accordingly, a smaller (child cuff) must be used for children and very slim adults or older patients with weak upper arm muscles.

        "Measuring your own blood pressure (at home / in everyday life) is very helpful; the threshold values for hypertension are always slightly lower than the values measured in the doctor's office.",
    "content": """
Blood pressure self-measurement is particularly helpful when a blood pressure-lowering therapy is started or changed. It is recommended to evaluate the therapeutic effect and it is useful for monitoring both drug therapy and non-drug measures. It is also helpful in the detection of practice hypertension or masked hypertension.

For blood pressure self-measurement at rest, somewhat lower normal values apply than those used for measurement in the doctor's office or in the clinic: The limit values of 135/85 mmHg correspond to the limit of 140/90 mmHg at the doctor's office. The classification, i.e. the division of the values into the categories mild, moderate and severe hypertension, refers to the [practice measurements](95). For self-measurement, the values are correspondingly somewhat lower in each case. However, to date there is no corresponding classification by the medical societies that is specifically applicable to the self-measured values.

**Misinterpretations can be avoided by measuring several times in a row.**

If the blood pressure exceeds the above mentioned limits, measure the blood pressure again after 1-2 minutes of relaxation. If a significantly lower value appears, the first measurement has not really been taken under physical rest and mental relaxation. If the first value is always significantly higher, this indicates inner tension and/or (negative) expectations. Sometimes it can also be useful to stop the self-measurement or to interrupt it for a certain time. If the blood pressure does not drop again "by itself" after a short time, active [relaxation](193) should take place; often it is already sufficient to take a few very deep and slow breaths ([deep breathing](194)). If the blood pressure is within the normal range, no second measurement is necessary.

If frequent blood pressure peaks occur even after relaxation, an ambulatory long-term blood pressure measurement should be performed in order to objectify the actual blood pressure level and blood pressure fluctuations with this method. During the long-term measurement the display should be switched off to avoid a (negative) feedback. Long-term measurement is the gold standard (i.e. the most suitable method) for assessing blood pressure in terms of severity, blood pressure fluctuations, and the day-night difference. Nocturnal blood pressure (during sleep) can only be assessed by long-term measurement. By definition, self-measured blood pressure at night while awake does not correspond to nighttime blood pressure while asleep.

**Blood pressure measurement with the upper arm cuff: Measurement at heart level on the loosely supported arm.**

The cuff should be deflated when put on and placed tightly about 2 cm above the elbow. Modern devices have a mark on the cuffs so that they can be positioned more easily. The measurement should be performed in a relaxed position, whereby the arm can be placed, for example, on a table or armchair. With oscillometric measuring devices (devices that measure without a microphone), the arm can also simply hang down loosely. The blood pressure should be measured at heart level (this corresponds approximately to the lower edge of the sternum). With the oscillometric devices commonly used today, the measurement is taken over the entire cuff. The measurement on the upper arm corresponds to the heart height.

Since the microphone is located at the lower end of the cuff during auscultatory measurement, the arm must be supported slightly forward (by placing it on the table or armrest) so that the microphone is at approximately heart level. The instructions for the individual devices provide information on the handling of the devices and the inflation height.

**Wrist blood pressure measurement: the wrist must be at heart level.**

When measuring at the wrist, it must be ensured that the wrist is approximately at heart level. Therefore, the arm should be positioned slightly higher than in the upper arm measurement. If the arms are crossed in front of the chest, the measuring arm can be placed relaxed on the other arm so that the wrist is approximately at the lower edge of the sternum. Some device manufacturers deliver with their devices an inflatable cushion on which the measuring arm can be placed.

Nevertheless, please ask your insurance company if you wish to purchase a device. If you buy a self-measuring device, you have invested well in your health.

The automatic devices commonly used today measure oscillometrically (i.e. without a microphone) on the upper arm or wrist. Devices that measure blood pressure on the finger or even in the ear are also under development. However, the upper arm devices with built-in stethoscope are still very suitable for self-measurement. An evaluation of the devices for self-measurement is carried out e.g. by the German High Pressure League. Ask in specialized medical shops and be well adviced before buying.

Measuring blood pressure in the doctor's office is an important measure and is standard in most practices. However, even a correctly performed practice measurement does not always allow a correct diagnosis, as some patients have white coat or practice hypertension or even masked hypertension.

The best way to do this is automatic long-term ambulatory blood pressure measurement over 24 hours with a portable device. Correctly performed self-measurement of blood pressure also plays an important role in the assessment of the blood pressure situation outside the practice in everyday life and can contribute to the detection of practice hypertension and masked hypertension.

The best data currently available on exercise hypertension is obtained by measuring the blood pressure during exercise on a bicycle ergometer. The standard limit for blood pressure under stress is 180-200 mmHg systolic at physical stress in the submaximal range, i.e. 100-125 watts.

Blood pressure is a very variable and dynamic quantity. Fluctuations in blood pressure are therefore within certain limits quite normal and also necessary. Blood pressure is usually lowest when we sleep or rest. It rises when we get excited or are physically active. In order to diagnose hypertension reliably, blood pressure must therefore be measured repeatedly under defined conditions.

Today, long-term ambulatory blood pressure measurement and self-measurement of blood pressure are of great importance. In an ambulatory long-term blood pressure measurement, the patient wears a device on their body for one day, which automatically measures and records the blood pressure over 24 hours (every 15 minutes during the day, every 30 minutes at night). 

Ambulatory long-term blood pressure measurement (ABDM) is the gold standard of blood pressure measurement for assessing the blood pressure situation in diagnostics and therapy control.

Blood pressure self-measurement, on the other hand, is performed - as the term already makes clear - by the patient themselves or a relative, over a certain period of time daily or several times a day.

**The following applies to long-term measurement and self-measurement: normal blood pressure exists up to values of 135/85 mmHg.**

With the ambulatory long-term blood pressure measurement and the self-measurement, blood pressure values are consistently somewhat lower than those measured by a doctor. For this reason, the standard values for these methods are also somewhat lower than for blood pressure measurement performed by a physician: Thus, the limit value of 135/85 mmHg (the average value of all values measured during the day, the so-called daily average) applies for both the blood pressure self-measurement and for the 24-hour long-term measurement - deviating from the limit value 140/90 mmHg in the doctor's practice. Long-term blood pressure measurement over 24 hours is the most objective method of measurement today and is considered the gold standard of blood pressure measurement in diagnostics and therapy assessment. The measurement is most reliable when the physician wants to determine in which range the blood pressure fluctuates over a 24-hour period, whether manifest hypertension is actually present and how the day-night rhythm is proceeding.

    "content": """
Blood pressure follows a very characteristic course in a 24-hour rhythm: The lowest values are usually during the night between 02.00 and 03.00 hours. In the morning hours the blood pressure then rises significantly. This rise begins shortly before getting up. The strongest rise in blood pressure occurs when getting up in the morning, with a peak around 9 o'clock. Many patients are surprised that their blood pressure is so high in the morning, for example when they measure their own blood pressure. In fact, the highest values are usually measured in the morning and mid-morning hours, by whatever method. If the rise in blood pressure in the morning is very steep and the blood pressure level is constantly too high, this can have serious consequences. Most strokes, heart attacks and other events, such as sudden cardiac death, severe cardiac arrhythmia, etc., accumulate in the morning hours, also with a peak around 09:00. Here there is a connection between poorly adjusted blood pressure and a steep rise in blood pressure in the morning and the occurrence of corresponding complications. It is therefore very important to take [medication](181) in such a way that the blood pressure is also well treated in the morning after getting up. This means that the blood pressure medication should be taken in the morning when getting up ("on the edge of the bed") so that the effect begins early.

**The normal day-night rhythm of blood pressure leads to blood pressure fluctuations of 10-30 mmHg in the course of 24 hours. This shows how important the time of day is in the assessment of blood pressure values.**

**Low at noon and second evening peak:** At noon, blood pressure drops slightly, only to rise again slightly during the afternoon. Around 6-7:00 p.m., blood pressure reaches a second, albeit smaller peak compared to the morning rise, and then drops again significantly during the night while sleeping.

    "content": """
Blood pressure is the pressure that the blood exerts on the walls of the blood vessels. It depends to a large extent on two factors, which can vary from person to person. The pressure with which our heart pumps the blood into the circulation and the elasticity and diameter of the vessels (arteries). If the blood pressure permanently exceeds certain limits, we speak of high blood pressure or hypertension. The limit values depend on the type of blood pressure measurement (e.g. self-measurement, practice measurement, long-term measurement) and various other factors, such as age and concomitant diseases.

When measuring blood pressure, two values are determined: first, the maximum pressure during the contraction or pumping phase of the heart (= systole) and second, the lower pressure during the filling phase of the heart (= diastole). The blood pressure itself is given in millimeters of mercury (= mmHg). Hg is the chemical abbreviation for mercury. The designation is traditionally based on the measurement with the mercury manometer used in the past. These devices are no longer permitted today because of the possible harmful effects of mercury. For example, a measurement result of 120/80 mmHg means that the upper (systolic) value corresponds to the pressure of a mercury column 120 mm high, the lower (diastolic) value to a mercury column 80 mm high.

The systolic blood pressure increases continuously with age as a result of the decreasing vascular elasticity of the arteries. The age of the vessels can therefore be deduced from the level of systolic blood pressure. The higher the systolic pressure, the more pronounced is the vascular stiffness or arteriosclerosis. It is still occasionally thought that the "normal value" for systolic blood pressure, which determines the upper blood pressure value and increases with age, can be calculated according to the rule of thumb "100 plus age". This rule is no longer valid today - it is simply wrong. Systolic blood pressure is more important for the cardiovascular system than diastolic pressure because it is associated with a higher risk and already indicates vascular damage.

The diastolic blood pressure also increases slowly and continuously with age, but unlike systolic blood pressure, it drops again on average in the 5th decade of life. The reason for this is a decreasing vascular elasticity and the restriction of vascular regulation. An increased diastolic blood pressure is usually found at the beginning of primary hypertension in younger and middle age, when there is no advanced vascular damage and the regulation of the vessels is not yet too badly damaged. The diastolic pressure is increased because the (peripheral) resistance in the vascular system increases. This in turn is the result of abnormal vascular tension.

The pulse rate or heart rate is not firmly linked to blood pressure.

The pulse rate is usually in the range of 60-80 beats per minute. A pulse rate that is too low, e.g. less than 50, is called bradycardia, and one that is too high, e.g. 90, is called tachycardia. Bradycardia can cause dizziness or syncope (fainting spells) and tachycardia means increased stress on the heart in the long run.

The blood pressure in the thoracic aorta is of greater importance than the blood pressure in the arm artery because of its closer relationship to the major central organs such as the brain, eyes, heart and kidneys. The usual measurement of blood pressure in the arm can only indicate systolic and diastolic blood pressure there. With modern PWA, the pressure in the aorta can also be determined. It has been shown that the blood pressure in the arm artery and the aortic pressure do not correspond in all types of hypertension ([masked aortic hypertension](73) and [juvenile systolic hypertension](71)).

The cause of high blood pressure in pregnant women is usually a pre-existing primary hypertension or the development of a so-called pregnancy hypertension in the second or third trimester. The so-called [pregnancy hypertension](87) usually disappears 1-2 weeks after delivery. However, pregnancy hypertension can also result in permanent hypertension that persists beyond delivery and increases the mother's cardiovascular risk. Women who develop gestational hypertension very often have hypertension again during the next pregnancy.

The rise in blood pressure is the most important criterion for the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia (so-called [pregnancy poisoning](87)). A rapid increase of 30 mmHg systolically or 15 mmHg diastolically is classified as threatening. Many young first-time mothers have blood pressure values around 100-110/60-70 mmHg in the 2nd trimester.

If these substances are not sufficient, other substances such as dihydralazine or labetalol (not available in Germany, however) or diuretics (water tablets) in low dosages can be used. The dosage of the substances and their combination depends on the severity of the hypertension.

**Breastfeeding time**

During the breastfeeding period after childbirth, all the usual blood pressure reducers can be used. However, there are only a few studies on this. It is therefore advisable to continue to take the medication that was successfully used to lower blood pressure during pregnancy. Possibly a dose adjustment must take place. 


**Recommendation for pregnant women: Reduce stress, be physically active regularly and do not gain too much weight.**

It is also important to avoid excessive weight gain, especially in women who are already overweight, as this can cause an increase in blood pressure. Stress avoidance and relaxation techniques are also important to prevent blood pressure increases, reduce stress and lower blood pressure. A restriction of the intake of table salt is not recommended during pregnancy. An increase in physical activity in the sense of regular exercise is also recommended, especially in the case of pregnancy hypertension. Aspirin (75-100 mg) and magnesium (300 mg) are suitable for pregnant women with increased risk of pre-eclampsia.

Hypertension is often referred to as the "silent killer" because the elevated blood pressure does not cause any discomfort, but is an increased risk. However, this is only half the truth: in fact, about 40% of hypertensive patients report typical morning headaches and/or dizziness*. These complaints are usually harmless and experience shows that they improve with good blood pressure control or disappear completely. If serious complaints / symptoms occur, such as [paralysis](128), [speech disorders](129), [heart complaints](132) or [shortness of breath](133), rapid medical treatment is necessary - regardless of the current blood pressure level.

Automatic blood pressure measurement can be affected by atrial fibrillation with irregular heartbeat. With the auscultatory method (e.g. in the practice, measurement by the doctor with a stethoscope) the blood pressure can also be accurately determined in patients with atrial fibrillation. Validation studies of automatic blood pressure devices (mostly oscillometric) show no difference at least for systolic blood pressure compared to manual auscultatory measurement. Diastolic blood pressure was slightly overestimated. However, this diastolic difference (i.e. the measurement error) is not so important, because atrial fibrillation occurs mainly in older age and systolic blood pressure has the greater prognostic significance here.

The heart is not the cause of hypertension. But the heart feels the consequences of hypertension because when blood pressure is high, it has to apply more and more force against the increased resistance in the vessels or pump the blood into stiffened arteries. The result is a thickening of the heart muscle and, as the disease progresses, an enlargement (dilatation) of the heart chambers. As a result, the blood supply to the heart itself is impaired, cardiac performance is weakened and cardiac arrhythmia (especially atrial fibrillation) can occur. This is known as hypertensive heart disease. The cause is reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to the thickened heart muscle. Especially during physical exertion and increased oxygen demand, the blood supply to the heart may be reduced, typically resulting in chest pain (angina pectoris) and shortness of breath.

Consistent and good blood pressure control can reduce the thickening of the heart muscle and the enlargement of the heart chambers and improve heart function.

The heart muscle in particular suffers from the constantly increased pressure. It thickens to withstand the high pressure in the vessels. As a result, heart function decreases and the oxygen demand of the heart increases. This can cause the patient to experience shortness of breath and [angina pectoris](132) (chest tightness), especially during physical exertion. With increasing duration of hypertension, the heart dilates and the heart muscle weakens (heart failure). This is the most common cause of heart failure, especially in older age. The development of heart muscle weakness can be avoided by a good blood pressure-lowering therapy that relieves the heart. Today, the usual blood pressure medications are at the same time the best substances for treating heart failure (cardiac insufficiency).

Only timely and correct treatment protects against the consequences of high blood pressure. By consistently lowering blood pressure, the risk of stroke, heart failure or kidney failure can be drastically reduced. This applies regardless of age. The success of the blood pressure-lowering therapy is even greater at an older age. The aim of all hypertension treatment, whether with or without medication, is therefore to normalize blood pressure as a prerequisite for reducing far-reaching health risks and increasing life expectancy again. Blood pressure-lowering therapy is one of the most successful preventive and therapeutic measures in modern medicine.

**Sports, healthy nutrition and weight loss can eliminate the causes of high blood pressure in some patients. With the right medication, however, blood pressure values can be normalized in practically all hypertensive patients.**

Drug therapy with antihypertensives is still a symptomatic therapy, i.e. even the most modern substances do not eliminate the causes of hypertension, but lower the blood pressure only as long as they are taken. If one wants to get to the causes of hypertension, non-drug measures are clearly superior. However, implementation requires an active approach and appropriate motivation. For many hypertension patients, it is more convenient to take medication than to change their diet permanently and take regular exercise. In fact, today any blood pressure can be brought down to the target range with the available medications.

Not all medications have the same effect on lowering blood pressure in all hypertensive patients. The effect cannot be predicted in each patient. It is therefore inevitable that several different medications must be tried out occasionally in order to achieve a satisfactory blood pressure reduction. However, it is important that both doctor and patient take their time. Only in a few cases is it necessary to lower blood pressure immediately and significantly. In the vast majority of cases it is possible to take time to lower blood pressure, i.e. a change in therapy should not be made too quickly. The maximum effect of most blood pressure medications is only reached after 3-4 weeks; a little patience is therefore necessary. It is also common today to start with only small amounts of a drug or combination and then gradually increase the dose if the blood pressure does not respond adequately; this also takes time.

**Which medications are most frequently prescribed?**

The main substances that are recommended today primarily for the medicinal lowering of blood pressure ([ACE inhibitors](170), [AT1 receptor blockers (Sartane)](171), [beta-blockers](169), [diuretics](172) and [calcium blockers](173)) have different points of attack and mechanisms of action, but are similar in their antihypertensive strength; however, the spectrum of side effects is very different. For this reason, it may also be necessary to try out different drugs if side effects occur.

If the keyhole or receptor is blocked by a drug, it is called a receptor blocker. Beta-receptors are located in many organs such as the heart, kidney, vessels, lungs, even in the bladder. They block the action of the "stress hormones" adrenaline and noradrenaline, thus reducing their effect on the organs, such as an increase in the pulse rate (heart rate), rise in blood pressure and vasoconstriction. The beta-blockers thus block the binding of the stress hormones noradrenaline and adrenaline to the beta-receptors of the arteries, the heart and other organs. They lead to lowering of blood pressure, reduction of heart rate (pulse rate) and decrease of heart work, especially under load and stress.

ACE stands for Angiotensin Conversion Enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for the formation of the hormone angiotensin - a very strong blood pressure increasing substance. Angiotensin could be described as a "vascular tensioner": It constricts the blood vessels and thus leads to tension in the vascular system with an increase in blood pressure - hypertension ultimately always refers to increased tension in the vascular system. The ACE inhibitors prevent the synthesis of angiotensin. This prevents or reduces its vasoconstrictive and blood pressure-increasing effect; in this way, ACE inhibitors reduce blood pressure.

**ACE inhibitors also directly protect heart and kidney function.**

Angiotensin does not only constrict blood vessels, but it also affects several organs, such as the heart, kidneys and adrenal glands. It has numerous effects on these organs, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure and to damage to the heart and kidney function. ACE inhibitors therefore have a positive effect here too.

The AT1 receptor blockers, or Sartane for short, are virtually a further development of the ACE inhibitors. They prevent the hormone angiotensin 2 from docking to its receptor. A receptor (binding site on a cell) is comparable to the keyhole into which the corresponding key must fit in order to function. The key in this picture is the hormone angiotensin. If the keyhole or receptor is blocked by a drug, this is called a receptor blocker. In this case the angiotensin receptor (AT1-receptor) is blocked. As a result, angiotensin 2 is unable to dock to the receptor and the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin 2 does not occur. As a result, blood pressure drops.

**Like ACE inhibitors, angiotensin antagonists also protect the heart and kidneys directly.**

The AT1 receptor blockers block the binding of angiotensin to the arteries and kidneys and thus lead to a reduction in blood pressure. Preventing the action of angiotensin on the various organs by blocking it with Sartans therefore has a similar beneficial effect as the use of ACE inhibitors.

Diuresis is the medical term for urination. Diuretics are substances that increase urine excretion via the kidneys. The site of action of diuretics is accordingly also the kidney.

However, it is by no means the case that taking diuretics or "water tablets" means that more and more urine is excreted. If this were the case, we would eventually "leak out". In fact, the water balance levels off to a new (lower) level, even though the urge to urinate may be slightly increased after each tablet. Increased water excretion occurs particularly at the beginning of therapy with diuretics, or if the patient starts again after a break (tablet forgotten or deliberately skipped).

The term calcium antagonists is not very accurate because it does not describe the effects correctly. Pharmacologically correct is the term calcium channel blocker. Calcium antagonists inhibit the absorption of calcium into the vascular muscle cell. Calcium is absorbed through so-called calcium channels, which are localized in every cell membrane. Our vessels actually have their own muscles, which, when activated appropriately, cause the vessels to constrict or contract. This requires calcium in the cells. The inhibition of the inflow of calcium into the cell leads to a relaxation and dilation of the vessels. Otherwise the calcium antagonists do not intervene in the calcium metabolism, in particular the calcium content of the bones is not affected.

**Some calcium antagonists also lower the heart rate, others only lower blood pressure.**

There are three different groups of calcium antagonists, which differ especially in their effect on heart rate: Verapamil and Diltiazem, like beta-blockers, have a lowering effect on both blood pressure and heart rate. The other substances change the heart rate little or lead to a slight increase. These drugs interfere with the exchange of calcium at the blood vessels and thus lead to a dilatation of the blood vessels and a reduction in blood pressure.

It is common practice today to start with only a low dose of a drug or combination and then gradually increase the dose if the blood pressure does not respond adequately. This procedure is called titration. The aim is to achieve the maximum effect on blood pressure with the lowest possible dose and, if possible, no side effects. This applies to so-called monotherapy with only one substance as well as the combination of several substances, possibly also as a fixed two- or three-way combination, i.e. 2 or 3 substances are combined in one tablet. Effects and side effects often vary depending on the dose: The side effects may occur only at higher doses or be much more pronounced, whereas blood pressure reduction does not occur much more strongly at higher doses. For this reason, the aim today is not always to use the maximum dose of a substance to its full potential, but rather to combine it early on with, for example, 2 or even 3 substances initially in low doses. For the selection of the combination therapy, the blood pressure level, i.e. the initial blood pressure, also plays an important role. Severe hypertension cannot usually be normalized with one substance alone, but requires an early combination. 

**When can a dose reduction be considered?**

Drug therapy of hypertension is almost always a long-term therapy, usually even a lifelong therapy. Only the permanent regular intake prevents the dreaded complications and long-term damage. Nevertheless, every hypertensive patient will sooner or later ask himself whether he really has to take the medication all the time. The answer is: Usually yes, but there are exceptions to this rule.

**Controlled discharge attempt**

If the blood pressure is very well adjusted over months - also because in addition to the drug therapy the non-drug measures have been successfully carried out - a dose reduction or even a controlled release attempt is recommended. Of course, this can only be done in consultation with the treating physician and with appropriate blood pressure controls. However, the idea that the blood pressure medication has "cured" the hypertension and that after a certain time it is no longer necessary to take it is wrong. Blood pressure is usually only well adjusted as long as it is treated. Very few patients will maintain a normal blood pressure for a long time after stopping the medication. The prerequisite is that the non-medical measures are carried out and "take effect". 

**Eliminate the cause of high blood pressure**

In most patients, blood pressure rises again after drug reduction or discontinuation. Unless the actual causes of hypertension are addressed or even eliminated, e.g. through significant weight loss, reduction of salt and alcohol, and regular exercise. An overweight hypertensive person who has actually lost 5-10 kg in the course of a year has a chance to normalize his or her blood pressure even without medication. This is why the so-called general measures or non-medicinal measures are so important. They should support and accompany any drug therapy. The best chances for a normalization of blood pressure even without medication are of course patients with only mild hypertension.

**Slow reduction**

The blood pressure tablets should not be stopped suddenly if possible, but should be reduced slowly. However, for a final assessment of whether you can manage without medication, your blood pressure must still be measured and evaluated weeks and months after you stop taking them. Discuss the correct procedure with your doctor and check your blood pressure yourself.

    "content": """
Taking dose is in the morning usually is the rule and it should be taken when getting up "on the edge of the bed" in order to initiate the pharmacological effect as early as possible and to achieve a rapid reduction of the high blood pressure, especially in the morning hours. As blood pressure rises sharply in the morning, especially after getting up, it is necessary to take the tablets in good time, as the effect of the tablets from the previous day is often not strong enough to sufficiently lower morning high blood pressure. It is often recommended to take the blood pressure medication in the morning with breakfast or after breakfast. The reason for this is that people think that the drugs are better tolerated if they are not taken on an empty stomach. However, experience shows that most patients have no problem at all in taking their morning medication as soon as they get up with a glass of water "on an empty stomach" on the edge of the bed.

**Why is it advisable to take tablets very early (before breakfast)?**

Taking the tablets after breakfast can be "too late" in individual cases: For example, if you get up at 7 a.m., have breakfast at 8 a.m. and take your blood pressure tablets around 8:30 a.m., the first slow effect on blood pressure will begin around 9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., i.e. a good 2 hours after getting up. This means that your blood pressure was unnecessarily treated 2 hours too late. By the way, most heart attacks and strokes occur around 09.00 in the morning. This is the time of the morning blood pressure peak. So there are very good reasons for taking your blood pressure as early as possible in the morning. Most blood pressure medications are very stomach-friendly, so it is sufficient to take them with a glass of water.

**Precautions and special situations**

Every patient with hypertension should - like any other patient who takes tablets regularly - always carry a note with the medication, dosage and prescription (medication schedule). Have your doctor draw up a detailed medication plan for you. This plan should be carried with you at all times, especially when traveling and away from home. When travelling, you should also always carry a sufficient supply of medication with you.

It is also important to note that for safety reasons, you should not drive after taking a new medicine for the first time. This also applies to a change of medication.

**Daily intake is important**

Most of the modern blood pressure medications have a 24-hour effect, i.e. they usually only need to be taken once a day (in the morning). Within the various substance groups, however, there are sometimes significant differences in the duration of the effect. Blood pressure therapy always means a daily therapy. Blood pressure medications are not taken after or on demand, i.e. when the blood pressure (measured randomly) is elevated. Such "on-demand therapy" is indeed very popular with many patients. But it is wrong and also not without danger. This irregular intake of medication causes considerable fluctuations in blood pressure; it is not possible to maintain a constant blood pressure control. With the "on-demand medication" you are always too late, i.e. it takes time to lower the already elevated blood pressure. If you stop taking the medication after it has been successfully reduced, sooner or later your blood pressure will automatically rise again because there is no longer any active substance to lower your blood pressure. This leads to a rise and fall in blood pressure. With a constant daily intake, the blood pressure is kept permanently low or within the normal range; this is the only way to successfully prevent consequential damage.

**You should only change the dosage of the medication in consultation with your doctor.**

An adjustment of the dose during vacation or for other reasons should only be made in consultation with the doctor. Usually a dose reduction is not necessary during vacation. It is by no means the case that for all hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lower on every vacation than in everyday life, at work or at home. In addition, there is no danger of a too strong reduction in blood pressure if the medication continues to be taken during the vacation.

**What you should keep in mind if you take them several times**

If severe hypertension is present, a combination therapy of several substances is required, which usually has to be taken in the morning and evening, possibly even several times a day. If the long-term blood pressure measurement shows an insufficient night-time lowering or even an increase in blood pressure during the night during the sleep phase, an additional evening dose is indicated. If several different substances have to be taken at different times of the day, a so-called tablet dispenser is absolutely necessary. This dosage aid can be obtained cheaply from any pharmacy. You can fill the entire stock for one week into the corresponding compartments. This prevents many mistakes in the daily dosage and reduces the number of forgotten tablets.

**Studies show that homeopathic remedies have no effect against high blood pressure; acupuncture probably has a positive effect if used regularly.**

There are very few acceptable studies on the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies in hypertensive patients. No effective reduction in blood pressure has been proven. The situation is similar with acupuncture. Here there are contradictory studies. An older study from Germany showed no blood pressure reduction by acupuncture compared to a control group. Another study showed a reduction in blood pressure, but only when used regularly two to three times a week.

A reduction of elevated blood pressure values even without taking medication is possible in many ways. Therefore, non-drug measures have a secure place in the treatment of high blood pressure, e.g. weight loss in overweight, restriction of salt intake and dietary changes, restriction of excessive alcohol consumption, sports and physical activity, stress management and relaxation procedures.

Dynamic sports that are performed with little effort, medium intensity, medium physical stress and low ambition are particularly suitable (e.g. Nordic walking, jogging, cycling) when it comes to healthy blood pressure values. On the other hand, strength sports with many static and acyclic elements, very high exercise intensity and a lot of physical stress are not favourable. The reason for this is that during endurance training the heart work is mainly done by increasing the heart rate (pulse rate) and less by increasing blood pressure. During weight training, on the other hand, there can be a very strong increase in blood pressure, while the heart rate is only slightly increased. Therefore, exercise is healthier for the heart and blood vessels than physical exertion.

**Beware of competition situations and physical exertion without sufficient warm-up**

Basically, the following applies to team and game sports: The more the focus is on playing with each other instead of against each other is the more suitable it is for the hypertensive person. For game sports such as soccer, handball, basketball, volleyball, field hockey, the following applies: As a competition, all these games require a large number of sudden starting and stopping movements. These fast, powerful actions involving large muscle groups cause the blood pressure to skyrocket. In addition, the game situation represents such a strong stimulus that all good intentions, such as holding back, are quickly forgotten. The warning symptoms of the body are often ignored. If ambition or disappointment comes into play, the stress hormones alone can cause blood pressure to skyrocket.

The situation is made worse in many cases by the fact that a large proportion of players enter the game without any physical preparation. Too often, there is no loosening and stretching of the muscles, nor is any thought given to stimulating the cardiovascular system in the first place. However, if all these factors are taken into account and the team sport is carried out sensibly and with enjoyment, this sport is also suitable for hypertension patients.

During physical exertion, breathing through the mouth and nose must be done simultaneously.

This is particularly important for beginners and those returning to sport. For those who are used to physical exertion, e.g. those who are experienced in sports, the [Breathing](38) adjust automatically. The body adapts the breathing to the demand.

The simplest relaxation works through conscious breathing! Pay attention to your breathing several times a day! Do I hold my breath in threatening and unpleasant situations? Do I breathe deeply or superficially? Breathing is automatic, but it can also be influenced at will. The goal of conscious breathing is a regular inhalation and exhalation flow, for example with a rhythm of 5-7 seconds for inhalation and also for exhalation.

A significant reduction in blood pressure can be achieved with just a few breaths using deep breathing. It is the simplest, fastest and most effective method of lowering high blood pressure immediately. Try it yourself if the first self-measurement shows an increased blood pressure: a deep and slow exhalation through the open mouth until the lungs are "empty", a short pause followed by a deep and slow inhalation through the nose without rushing. This allows you to measure significantly lower blood pressure values after just a few breaths during the follow-up measurement. 
Deep breathing can be practiced anywhere and without effort and should be used especially at the desk and in stressful situations. Because of the simplicity of its practicability and its effectiveness on blood pressure, this is an optimal relaxation method.

The purpose of progressive muscle relaxation ("progressive muscle relaxation") is to experience tension and relaxation, the alternation of pressure and pressure relief. The technique consists of consciously tensing and relaxing all muscle groups of the body, one after the other, from the head to the toes. This is done in a steady rhythm, in a comfortable sitting position, with eyes closed. The technique is very popular and is relatively easy to learn.

**Relax with progressive muscle relaxation**
Read through the exercises several times, try them out and "internalize" them. Then adopt a comfortable sitting position and close your eyes. Now tense and relax your muscles in the following order. You can also get instructions from your partner.

**Forearms**
* **Tension:** Clench a fist (about 5-8 seconds) and pay attention to the feeling of tension in the muscles of the forearm and hand.
* **Relaxation:** Release completely (about 30 seconds). Observe the sensations in the relaxed forearm and hand (perhaps tingling, warmth, heaviness, pleasant relaxation). Repeat the exercise with both fists.

**Upper arms: Biceps**
* **Tension:** Tense the biceps muscles by bending the arms. The forearm muscles should remain as relaxed as possible.
* **Relaxation:** Let your arms rest comfortably and completely relaxed. Pay attention to the different sensations - loosening and releasing - in the upper arm muscles compared to the tension.

**Upper arms: Triceps**
* **Tension:** Tense the tricep muscles by stretching the arms. If you practice lying down, leave your forearms flat on the floor and press them down against the floor. The palms of your hands should point upwards.
* **Relaxation:** Release the tension and let the shoulders fall. Pay attention to the feeling of relaxation in the shoulders.

**Shoulders**
* **Tension:** Pull the shoulders up and tense the shoulder muscles.
* **Relaxation:** Release the tension and let the shoulders fall. Pay attention to the feeling of relaxation in the shoulders.

**Neck and face**
* **Neck:** Press the head backwards and tense the neck muscles. Then let go again completely.
* **Face:** Bite your teeth together, squeeze your eyes together, tense your facial muscles by making a grimace. Then relax the face muscles again.

**Back and stomach**
* **Back muscles:** Tense the back muscles by pulling the shoulder blades backwards. Then release the tension of the back muscles completely.
* **Abdominal muscles:** Tense the abdominal muscles by making the abdominal wall "hard" or by pulling or pushing the abdomen in or out. Release the abdominal muscles again.

**Legs**
* **Thigh and gluteal muscles:** Squeeze the gluteal cheeks together, tense the thighs. Then release the tension again.
* **Lower thigh calf muscles:** Press your feet and toes down (away from your face) so that you feel tension in the calf muscles. Then relax the calf muscles and let your legs rest comfortably.
* **Shin muscles:** Pull your toes and feet towards your face so that you feel tension in your shins. Then let go and let your legs rest comfortably again.

**If you do not want to sleep afterwards, end the exercise by bending and stretching your arms firmly several times. If you like, you can also stretch. Then take a deep breath and open your eyes again.**

Biofeedback means "feedback of biological (or physiological) reactions" to the patient. This is usually done with the aid of special equipment; for example, the depth and frequency of breathing can be communicated to the patient via an optical or acoustic signal (light display or sound). In the best case, this enables the patient to direct various bodily functions towards relaxation. In this way it is also possible to influence body reactions that are normally not under our voluntary control, such as blood pressure.

**With Biofeedback the current blood pressure can be continuously displayed graphically and influenced with appropriate training.**

The direct feedback of blood pressure has only recently become possible with a new procedure. The blood pressure is continuously measured with a finger cuff during a session and displayed in a graphically animated form as a "blood pressure column" on a monitor. The blood pressure column changes in color and height. Thus all current blood pressure fluctuations can be reported back immediately. Through this continuous feedback, patients experience for the first time that they can influence their blood pressure themselves. Individual influences on blood pressure are examined and tracked down. The hypertensive patient learns how to lower and control his blood pressure themselves.

    "content": """
**Sauna** and Kneipp's methods are essentially based on the fact that the heat regulation (thermoregulation) of the body is forced by temperature differences to react and adapt to different situations. This is also very useful for the hypertensive person. Perhaps, even positive effects on blood pressure can be expected. Mild temperature stimuli stabilize many vegetatively (unconsciously) controlled functions - extreme temperature stimuli, however, should be avoided by hypertension patients! Because: Extreme external influences cause extreme reactions of the circulation and thus of the blood pressure.

**Persons with high blood pressure should avoid strong cold or heat stimuli and extreme temperature changes.**

Attention should be paid particularly to the cold stimulus during sauna sessions, which can lead to a sudden, explosive rise in blood pressure. Temperatures of just over 20° C are sufficient for the thermal alternating stimulus during cooling down; they are effective in terms of health and better tolerated with regard to the blood pressure reaction. During the heat wave in the sauna, extreme temperatures and above all frequent infusions should be avoided. On the lower setting, sweating can be achieved more gently than on the higher setting. When immersed in cold water, the blood vessels contract and blood pressure rises. The greater the difference to body temperature and the more sudden the transition is, the higher the blood pressure increases. Even for people with normal blood pressure, the jump into the ice-cold plunge pool causes the pressure to rise to values of systolic over 200 mmHg. A hypertensive person with pre-damaged blood vessels should therefore better refrain from such a jump, which is not very useful anyway. So the following applies: Keep a moderate temperature when cooling down, do not choose too low temperatures and change the temperature slowly and not suddenly. Then the sauna is a good place for relaxation and strengthening. In addition, salt is also excreted with sweat.

**Forearm baths à la Kneipp**

Regular arm baths lead to a reduction of the resistance in the circulatory system. Relaxed vessels mean dilatation, i.e. pressure relief. It has been proven that arm baths with rising temperatures cause blood pressure values to drop over several hours. Used over a longer period of time, there is a lasting effect. Procedure: Let water of 37°C run into your wash basin. Dip both arms into it and increase the water temperature to about 42°C over 15-20 minutes. Add hot water if you feel the water is no longer warm enough. Afterwards you should rest for half an hour.

In addition to stress factors and overweight, an unhealthy diet plays a major role in the development of hypertension: too much salt, too many calories, too much alcohol, too much fat and "wrong fat", especially in finished, industrially produced foods. It is therefore generally better to use fresh food and to prepare the food yourself. Many hypertensive patients are dependent on canteen food and therefore find it difficult to follow the dietary recommendations. One option, of course, is to take home-prepared food to work either always or at least occasionally (twice a week). Many larger canteens now also offer vegetarian or vegan food, which is usually fresher and healthier for the hypertensive person, as it contains more vitamins, minerals (especially potassium) and fiber.

**The most important nutritional principles**
* Decrease the intake of common salt by eating fresh food instead of canned, fast food and frozen dishes, which often have a high salt content.
* Increase in potassium intake by daily consumption of fruit, salad and vegetables.
* Preference of vegetable fats such as oils, nuts and seeds (e.g. sunflower, pumpkin and pine nuts) over animal fats.
* Restriction of the intake of saturated fatty acids from high-fat sausage and high-fat cheese.
* Increase in fiber intake, e.g. by regular consumption of baked goods made of wholemeal flour instead of white and mixed breads.
* Saving sugar and avoiding fructose e.g. in soft drinks.
* Daily fluid intake of 1.5-2 liters by calorie-free and low-sodium drinks.
* Restriction of excessive consumption of alcohol.

The recommendations for a [low-salt diet](53) have little chance of success as long as only the "visible" table salt is avoided, but the most important source of salt, namely industrially processed and prepackaged food, is disregarded. In the household, only about 1-2 g of salt are consumed for the preparation of food and for adding salt at the table. 80% of the table salt consumed daily, however, is "hidden" in already prepared food. By far the most important are the "basic foods": bread and baked goods as well as cheese, meat and sausages, canned and frozen foods. Only the smallest part of the consumed salt comes from the own salt shaker.

**Finished products are mixed with salt for a variety of reasons.**

In the industrial production of food, common salt is not only added for taste reasons. It is also widely used as a preservative, e.g. for canned vegetables, meat, sausage and fish, and as a technological additive, e.g. for loosening dough in bread and bakery products or for binding water in sausage production. In addition, numerous sodium salts are used as auxiliary agents and additives that do not taste salty. For example: Sodium nitrite and nitrate for curing meat, fish and sausage products; sodium phosphates as melting salt in the production of processed cheese; sodium alginate as thickening agent for ice cream, ready-made puddings, soups and sauces; sodium glutamate as flavor enhancer.

    "content": """
A diet that is low in salt (low in sodium) and rich in potassium at the same time lowers high blood pressure more effectively than a low-sodium diet alone! Potassium is a vital mineral. The human organism's requirement for potassium is about 2000-3000 mg per day, which is approximately equal to the sodium requirement. However, while the sodium intake is consistently too high, the potassium intake with the daily diet is often rather too low. This is partly due to the fact that potassium losses occur when food is processed, while sodium is added abundantly via table salt. This changes the sodium-potassium ratio unfavorably.
However, a high potassium intake is desirable because potassium has a protective effect against the blood pressure-increasing effect of sodium. This can already play a role in the prevention of high blood pressure. In the case of high blood pressure, a higher potassium intake promotes, among other things, an increased excretion of sodium and water from the body, which leads to a reduction in blood pressure. Studies have shown that a diet low in salt and rich in potassium can protect children of hypertensive parents who are already at risk from developing hypertension in adulthood.

**Some patients benefit particularly from a high potassium intake, others should be more careful with potassium.**

Patients taking diuretics ("water tablets") to lower blood pressure benefit particularly from a higher potassium intake. Only patients with advanced kidney dysfunction should limit their potassium intake. If you have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction, you should ask your doctor whether you should limit your potassium intake. With normal kidney function, up to 15 g of potassium are excreted without any problems.

However, potassium should not be taken in tablet form without a doctor's prescription. The best intake is via potassium-rich foods such as potatoes or legumes.

There is not enough data to recommend garlic or beetroot as a long-term therapy for hypertension. A daily dose of at least 600-1000 mg of dried garlic powder is necessary to achieve an effect on blood pressure. This corresponds to about 1.8-3.0 g of fresh garlic. Eating garlic daily, whether fresh or in powder form, is ultimately a matter of taste!

    "content": """
Vitamin D plays an essential role in the regulation of calcium metabolism and thus also influences the regulation of blood pressure. Recent studies show that a lack of vitamin D is found more frequently among hypertensive patients and that taking vitamin D can lower blood pressure. Vitamin D is actually not a vitamin, because our body can form active vitamin D in the skin through sunlight (UV light) from preliminary stages. By definition, however, vitamins cannot be produced by the body itself, but must be supplied with food. Vitamin D is therefore actually a hormone.

**Vitamin D contributes in various ways to lowering blood pressure.**

As the research results of the last few years show, vitamin D has, among many other important functions, a special significance in the regulation of blood pressure. Hypertensive patients, for example, often have a vitamin D deficiency. This also affects our population in Germany. Vitamin D reduces the activity of a hormone system that increases blood pressure (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) and plays an essential role in regulating calcium metabolism. Vitamin D affects blood pressure via these two mechanisms. Therefore, in cases of vitamin D deficiency, substitution is very sensible and useful.

**Vitamin D deficiency particularly affects older people with hypertension.**

A deficiency occurs particularly during low sun exposure and in winter. With age, the skin's ability to form the active vitamin D decreases. In people over 70, the ability is reduced to about a quarter. It is therefore not surprising that older hypertension patients in particular have a relatively frequent vitamin D deficiency.

**If a vitamin D deficiency is detected, one should possibly take vitamin D tablets for a while.**

In general, the amounts of vitamin D in food are rather small. In food, vitamin D is found mainly in fatty fish and dairy products (see table below). The daily vitamin D requirement for adults is at least 400 IU (international units) corresponding to 10 µg. A vitamin deficiency does not cause acute complaints, but can permanently cause various organ and cell disorders. We can measure the vitamin D level in the blood. If a vitamin D deficiency is proven, the diet should be changed and possibly vitamin D should be taken in tablet form over a certain period of time. This treatment must be medically indicated and monitored. By the way, other vitamins are not of major importance for the regulation of blood pressure.

**Unfortunately, not much vitamin D can be taken in through food alone, but fatty fish and dairy products are best suited for this purpose.**

The vitamin D content of some selected foods shows the minor role of food in the vitamin D supply (1 µg corresponds to 40 IU):

* Cod liver oil: 300 µg /100 g *
* Smoked eel: 21 µg /100 g *
* Salmon: 16 µg /100 g *
* Sardine: 11 µg /100 g *
* Veal: 3.8 µg /100 g *
* Chicken egg: 2.9 µg /100 g *
* Mushrooms: 1.9 µg /100 g *
* Liver (bovine): 1.7 µg /100 g *
* Butter: 1.2 µg /100 g *
* Cream: 1.1 µg /100 g *
* Emmental: 1.1 µg /100 g *
* Gorgonzola: 1 µg /100 g *
* Edam 40% fat in dry matter: 0.29 µg /100 g *
* Edible quark 40% fat in dry matter: 0.19 µg /100 g *
* Whole milk min. 3.5% fat: 0.088 µg /100 g *
* Yoghurt min. 3.5% fat: 0.062 µg /100 g *

*µg vitamin D/100 g food

**Recommendation: Have your vitamin D level in the blood determined, especially in winter. If a deficiency is proven, it is recommended to take vitamin D in tablet form and to check the level accordingly. This concerns especially patients with high blood pressure.**

Sufficient sleep, relaxing vacations and recreative hobbies are part of the general relaxation for every hypertensive person. The goal of the various relaxation techniques is to become generally more relaxed and composed in order to be able to react calmly instead of stressed even in acute stress situations. For relaxation you have to take your time. To do so, one must get comfortable and shield oneself from external influences (telephone, television, appointments). The choice of relaxation technique depends on the one hand on the local offer of appropriate courses and therapists, and on the other hand on personal ideas and expectations. Therefore, the principle of the different relaxation techniques should only be briefly mentioned here.

The purpose of progressive muscle relaxation ("progressive muscle relaxation") is to experience tension and relaxation, the alternation of pressure and pressure relief. The technique consists of consciously tensing and relaxing all muscle groups of the body, one after the other, from the head to the toes. This is done in a steady rhythm, in a comfortable sitting position, with eyes closed. The technique is very popular and is relatively easy to learn.

**Relax with progressive muscle relaxation**
Read through the exercises several times, try them out and "internalize" them. Then adopt a comfortable sitting position and close your eyes. Now tense and relax your muscles in the following order. You can also get instructions from your partner.

**Forearms**
* **Tension:** Clench a fist (about 5-8 seconds) and pay attention to the feeling of tension in the muscles of the forearm and hand.
* **Relaxation:** Release completely (about 30 seconds). Observe the sensations in the relaxed forearm and hand (perhaps tingling, warmth, heaviness, pleasant relaxation). Repeat the exercise with both fists.

**Upper arms: Biceps**
* **Tension:** Tense the biceps muscles by bending the arms. The forearm muscles should remain as relaxed as possible.
* **Relaxation:** Let your arms rest comfortably and completely relaxed. Pay attention to the different sensations - loosening and releasing - in the upper arm muscles compared to the tension.

**Upper arms: Triceps**
* **Tension:** Tense the tricep muscles by stretching the arms. If you practice lying down, leave your forearms flat on the floor and press them down against the floor. The palms of your hands should point upwards.
* **Relaxation:** Release the tension and let the shoulders fall. Pay attention to the feeling of relaxation in the shoulders.

**Shoulders**
* **Tension:** Pull the shoulders up and tense the shoulder muscles.
* **Relaxation:** Release the tension and let the shoulders fall. Pay attention to the feeling of relaxation in the shoulders.

**Neck and face**
* **Neck:** Press the head backwards and tense the neck muscles. Then let go again completely.
* **Face:** Bite your teeth together, squeeze your eyes together, tense your facial muscles by making a grimace. Then relax the face muscles again.

**Back and stomach**
* **Back muscles:** Tense the back muscles by pulling the shoulder blades backwards. Then release the tension of the back muscles completely.
* **Abdominal muscles:** Tense the abdominal muscles by making the abdominal wall "hard" or by pulling or pushing the abdomen in or out. Release the abdominal muscles again.

**Legs**
* **Thigh and gluteal muscles:** Squeeze the gluteal cheeks together, tense the thighs. Then release the tension again.
* **Lower thigh calf muscles:** Press your feet and toes down (away from your face) so that you feel tension in the calf muscles. Then relax the calf muscles and let your legs rest comfortably.
* **Shin muscles:** Pull your toes and feet towards your face so that you feel tension in your shins. Then let go and let your legs rest comfortably again.

**If you do not want to sleep afterwards, end the exercise by bending and stretching your arms firmly several times. If you like, you can also stretch and extend. Then take a deep breath and open your eyes again.**

Water applications are not forbidden for hypertension patients, but can certainly contribute to lowering blood pressure when used correctly. Even a warm bath for 30-40 minutes leads to a significant reduction in blood pressure. Because of the increased pressure of the water on the chest, the heart releases a blood pressure-lowering hormone, the ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide). The prerequisite is that the entire thorax is actually under water. The heart tries to relieve itself from the increased pressure and the associated circulatory stress caused by the ANP release: ANP leads to increased water excretion via the kidneys. ANP is the body's natural opponent of the blood pressure-increasing hormone renin.

Cognitive restructuring is a term used in psychology to describe methods aimed at a healthier handling of events and stimuli. The first step is to identify the conscious and unconscious meanings and evaluations of, for example, stress factors. If the patterns of meaning and evaluation are very negative and self-damaging, one can try to consciously change these patterns in order to reduce one's own stress reaction. In this way, an unhealthy rise in blood pressure in stressful situations can also be reduced or even prevented. For this it requires first the self reflection and recognition of the own evaluation system. Afterwards a conscious and continuous training is necessary. This can possibly be done with the support of a behavioral therapist.

**Bleeding**
Cupping or bloodletting was a very popular therapy for lowering high blood pressure before the drug era. And it was and still is a very successful therapy. The withdrawal of e.g. 500 ml of blood when donating blood leads to a lasting reduction in blood pressure. Nevertheless, bloodletting is not a method that can be recommended today as a permanent therapy for hypertension. If you donate blood regularly, you should always do so in consultation with your family doctor. However, regular bloodletting therapy is very useful in the case of [polyglobulia](83) or [polycythaemia](84) vera.

**Acupuncture**
Acupuncture, like many other so-called alternative therapies, is recommended time and again for the treatment of hypertension. Scientifically useful studies that can prove a long-term effect on blood pressure are not yet available. Many applications have an immediate or short-term so-called placebo effect, which is completely unspecific and can by no means be used as evidence for a blood pressure-lowering therapy. In terms of the placebo effect, there are many influences on blood pressure, which depends very much on our inner mood, emotions and stress. However, this should not be equated with a permanent antihypertensive therapy. Measure your blood pressure yourself: This way you can easily control all influences on your blood pressure. A recent examination confirms a reduction in blood pressure, but only if you use it regularly two or three times a week.

**Homeopathics**
The same applies to [homeopathic](185) as to the herbal preparations: there is no scientific evidence for a significant and lasting reduction in blood pressure. Homeopathy uses arnica, mistletoe and rauwolfia, among others, to lower blood pressure. A drug therapy cannot be permanently replaced by a homeopathic treatment. There are no corresponding studies.

**Music therapy**
The healing effects of music have been known for many thousands of years and in many different cultures. Today, music therapy is also used in clinics as a complementary method within the framework of holistic treatment.
* Studies show that the level of the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol can be reduced by up to 20% with soothing music.
* Numerous studies have shown that patients require less anaesthetic if they listen to music before and during surgery.
* Music also makes it easier for mother and child to give birth in the delivery room.
* And premature babies develop better when they are played a mixture of female voices, sounds from the womb and relaxation music.
* For infarct patients, additional music and relaxation therapy has a stress-reducing effect and supports the prognosis and healing process.

Music has a proven influence on breathing, heartbeat, blood pressure and brain waves and is therefore suitable as a supplement to any medication that may be necessary and to general measures such as weight loss, endurance sports, low-salt nutrition, etc.

Therefore, the electrical or mechanical stimulation of the carotissinus acutely causes a significant reduction in blood pressure.

There are now a large number of "fixed" combinations, i.e. tablets containing two or even three different substances. Today, combination preparations are not only used for severe or difficult-to-control hypertension, but also at the beginning of therapy for mild and moderate hypertension. In these cases, however, the drugs are initially given in low or very low doses so that the blood pressure is not immediately reduced too much. The dose may be increased as the treatment progresses. The basis of a combination is usually an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor blocker combined with a diuretic. If necessary, further combinations can then be made according to the step-by-step scheme described below.

**Advantages of fixed combination preparations**

The fixed combination of two or even three different substances in one tablet has the following advantages:

* Stronger reduction of blood pressure if one substance is not enough,
* sensible addition of the various substances,
* lower dosage, fewer side effects,
* fewer tablets.

The combinations are useful if the effects of the two or more substances complement each other or cancel out side effects, e.g. also in the combination of a potassium-losing diuretic with a potassium-saving diuretic (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide plus triamterene or amiloride). The diuretics are considered the best combination partner for all other substances. They are therefore an essential part of every combination therapy. Favorable combinations for a two or multiple combination are

* Diuretic plus ACE inhibitor
* Diuretic plus AT1-Blocker
* Diuretic plus beta-blocker
* Diuretic plus calcium antagonist
* Diuretic plus ACE inhibitor plus calcium antagonist
